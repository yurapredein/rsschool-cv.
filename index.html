Briefly About Myself:
I recently started to get involved in the development of websites and applications. I like it when you immediately see the result of what you do. It's very exciting when you succeed, especially if you find a mistake and then you succeed. At the moment I work in Salesforce as an office manager. But in my spare time, I practice and learn Javascript.
I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

Skills and Proficiency:
HTML5, CSS3
JavaScript Basics
Git, GitHub
VS Code
Adobe Photoshop
